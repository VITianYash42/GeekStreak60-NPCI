# 🚀 60 Days POTD Challenge Powered By NPCI

Welcome to my repository for the **#GeekStreak60** challenge! 
This is a 60-day sprint of solving the GeeksforGeeks Problem of the Day (POTD), maintained daily to build a rock-solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 🎯 Goal
To maintain a 60-day streak of solving complex DSA problems, focusing on optimized approaches, clean code, and time/space complexity analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++
* **Topics Covered:** Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more.
